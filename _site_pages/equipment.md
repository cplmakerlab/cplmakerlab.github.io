## Lasercutting

![](/uploads/equipment/full-spectrum-laser-h-series-20-x-12-laser-cutter-orig.jpg){: width="500" height="281"}

* **Full Spectrum 45W CO2 H-Series Engraver/Cutter (5th gen)**
  * Bed Size: 20" x 12" (in practice, usable area is closer to 19.5" x 11.5")
  * Machine Software: [RetinaEngrave](http://laser101.fslaser.com/RetinaEngrave){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
  * Design Software: [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
  * Modes: [Vector Cut, Vector Engrave, Raster Fill](https://lasercuttingsheffield.wordpress.com/engraving-and-cutting/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
  * Materials: Most wood/acrylic up to 1/4" thick. [See the approved materials list](materials#approved-lasercutter-materials) and [suggested lasercutter settings](materials#suggested-lasercutter-settings).
  * [Download Inkscape (v.92) Lasercut Design Template (SVG)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cplmakerlab/general/master/templates/cplmakerlab-lasercut-template-inkscape-v92.svg){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
  * **DESIGN FILE PREPARATION**
    * File Format: SVG (file must open in [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"})
    * VECTOR CUT: Stroke paint is 100% RED \[RGBA(255,0,0,255) or 000000ff\]. Stroke width is .003 inches.
    * VECTOR ENGRAVE: Stroke paint is 100% BLACK \[RGBA(0,0,0,255) or 000000ff\]. Stroke width is .003 inches.
    * RASTER FILL: Fill color is 100% BLACK \[RGBA(0,0,0,255) or 000000ff\]. No stroke.
    * For all strokes and fills, alpha transparency is 100% and opacity is 100%
    * No special shapes or text. All texts and shapes must be paths (Path -&gt; Object to Path)
    * Everything is ungrouped (CTRL+A to select all, CTRL + SHIFT + G to ungroup)
    * File opens in RetinaEngrave without errors, no missing sections or parts. Time estimate must not exceed Maker Lab time limit.&nbsp;

## 3D Printing

* **Makerbot Replicator 2**
  * Build Volume: 6.0 in x 6.1 in x 11.2 in (410 cubic inches)
  * Machine Software: [Makerbot Desktop (slicer software)](https://support.makerbot.com/troubleshooting/makerbot-desktop-software/software-download/download_12190){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
  * Design software: [Tinkercad](http://tinkercad.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (any 3D cad software that can output OBJ or STL)
  * Material: [PLA filament](materials)
  * [Download example STL file](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/94/00/bf/48/20/Harold-Washington-CPLMakerLab.stl){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
  * **DESIGN FILE PREPARATION**
    * File Format: STL or OBJ
    * File opens in machine software without errors.
    * Check object orientation in machine software to minimize the need for rafts & supports.
    * Check if size looks correct (not too big or small). Fine details may not print well at smaller sizes.
    * In machine software, check time estimate using desired print settings. Typical layer height is .3mm. Print time must not exceed Maker Lab time limit.&nbsp;
